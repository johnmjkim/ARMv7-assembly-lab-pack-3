# COMP2300/6300 lab-pack-3 template repo

This contains the lab weekly repos for:
   - [07-data-structures](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/07-data-structures/)
   - [08-interrupts](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/08-interrupts/)
   - [09-inputs-and-outputs](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/09-inputs-and-outputs/)

## VSCode Instructions

Once you've forked and cloned this repo, you must make sure to open the `week-N` sub-folders in VSCode (where N is the current week), not the whole lab-pack repository.  
You can do this in VSCode by doing:  
- `File -> Open Folder... -> week-X.`  

If you don't open a sub-folder, the COMP2300 VSCode extension won't know how to build your code.
